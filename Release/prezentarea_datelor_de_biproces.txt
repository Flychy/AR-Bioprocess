	The study of bioprocesses highlights the principles that underlie life
systems.
	Bioprocesses are complex transformations of organic chemicals/inorganic,
introduced into the culture medium, in products of interest
economic.
	These transformations (conversions) represent a set of reactions performed
of living cells. Cells perform these conversions to acquire some metabolic products
(substances that are required for components at the cellular level of synthesis) or to obtain
increase or maintenance energy. At the same time, the cells are directed towards
specific transformations of substrates into useful products by appropriate procedures.
	This application presents an exact analysis of a bioprocess performed on water.
It has been observed the evolution in time, more precisely an interval of 17 hours, on this substance,
following some essential characteristics such as D.O, its pH, Substrate S (mg / 100 mL),
and Dissolved oxygen concentration (O), in specific percentage.
	The application provides a clear display of bioprocess data, experimental data, on
which will translate them into a graph with specific characteristics (bioprocess, respectively
time). It is worth mentioning that with the drawing of the bioprocess-time characteristic, grace augmented reality the user can observe the data at precise times
corresponding to the bioprocess at that time.
